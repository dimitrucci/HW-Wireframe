                    <h1>First day in Siberia</h1>
                    <p>In this blog about my Siberia travel adventure I will tell you all about my experiences on my road trip to Altai Mountains, one of the most beautiful places to visit in Russia. A Siberia holiday is not a standard trip, but definitely something to consider if you are into adventure travel.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Travel tip #1</h2>
                    <p>Traveling off the beaten track also has its disadvantages because making my way to Siberia was not the most smooth journey. I think in general if you take a trip to Russia you will underestimate its size. By far the biggest country on earth and so immense vast that traveling by car for more than 1,000 kilometers is normal.
                       I flew into Moscow first and spent the night at a random airport hotel, then the next morning I flew onwards to Barnaul, a pretty big city in Southern Siberia where my road trip into the Altai Mountains started. I had never heard of Barnaul, but no wonder. 
                       It is not a touristy place at all and just about 400 kilometers from the Kazakhstan border, while the Chinese and the Mongolian border are only 700 kilometers away either.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Travel tip #2</h2>
                    <p>It is a common thing to say for Western people that Russians are unfriendly. Not the family I met though! These people were super lovely and although communicating was very hard, we bonded straight away. Russians literally don’t speak a word English. If you are lucky they know how to say thank you, but much more than that is utopia. 
                       I felt like I was in China, because reading the Russian alphabet is impossible too. I found out pretty quickly that traveling in Russia was a challenge! :
                       To communicate I used a translator app. You literally just speak to your phone and the translation pops up straight away. If you travel to Russia, download one!
                    </p>

    <aside>
            <p class="assided">With an area of nearly 10 million sq km., Siberia is vast. While the popular view of Siberia is of howling Arctic wastes dotted with penal colonies, the truth is more complex. The west of Siberia is covered by a swampy plain, the central plateau is heavily forested, and the east has mountains soaring to above 3,000 m. Only the extreme north is true tundra, where temperatures can reach -68°C in winter.
